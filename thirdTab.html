      <h1>Climate Issues In Afghanistan</h1>
      <p>Afghanistan’s government has warned that climate change is putting “the foundation
        of the country’s economy, stability, and food security under threat”1. Yet the very real
        risk posed by climate change to Afghanistan's development is usually overshadowed
        by the more immediate and visible concerns around conflict and economic crisis. This
        general perception of climate change as a secondary priority suggests that it is still
        misconceived as a purely technical, environmental problem—somehow distinct from
        socio-economic concerns.  </p>
        <p>Climate change does not occur in a vacuum: its impacts are intrinsically linked to the
        economic and security concerns which are at the top of the government’s priorities.
        Climate change will make it extremely challenging to maintain—let alone increase—
        any economic and development gains achieved so far in Afghanistan. Increasingly
        frequent and severe droughts and floods, accelerated desertification, and decreasing
        water flows in the country’s glacier-dependent rivers will all directly affect rural live-
        lihoods—and therefore the national economy and the country’s ability to feed itself. It
        is now widely acknowledged that “large parts of the [country’s] agricultural economy
        will become marginal without significant investment in water management and irriga-
        tion.”1 Given the importance of agriculture to Afghanistan’s economy and food securi-
        ty— agriculture is a source of income for 61%  of the country’s 29.1 million people,
        and accounts for 44% of employment (self-employed or salaried)2— this could in-
        crease both the number of food insecure people, and the severity of food insecurity
        (from transient/ seasonal to chronic, and from moderate to acute).  </p>
        <p>As conventional crops becomes less and less viable in some areas due to drought and
          desertification, rural populations will increasingly be driven to alternative livelihood
          options—including the production of less water-intensive poppy and, potentially, in-
          surgency. The question of whether and how conflict and climate change are linked is
          still hotly debated. However, there is growing empirical evidence that while climate
          disasters are rarely the primary trigger for conflict outbreaks, they can exacerbate
          existing societal tensions—significantly enhancing the risk that a volatile situation will
          break out in conflict, or that a conflict which might otherwise have subsided will per-
          sist. A recent study found that the link between climate disasters and conflict was par-
          ticularly strong in ethnically divided countries, and was stronger for droughts and
          heatwaves than for floods.  </p>
          <p>In Afghanistan specifically, some studies have linked reduced rainfall or irrigation flows
            in some areas with increased poppy production —which could in turn have helped fi-
            nance and fuel the insurgency in the area.  </p>
        <p>From a development and humanitarian perspective, climate change most directly and
          heavily affects the poorest people—particularly subsistence farmers and pastoralists
          who are already living on marginal land. The first step in helping Afghanistan's most
          vulnerable people to cope with and adapt to climate change is therefore understand-
          ing which areas and livelihoods are being most severely affected. This study is an at-
          tempt to better understand how climate hazards impact people—not just geographic
          areas. In other words, the aim is to go beyond simply showing which areas are highly
          prone to drought or floods, and instead to highlight how these shocks actually affect
          the people living in those areas—based on their livelihoods. </p>
          <p>The guiding question was therefore not “where have droughts or floods become more
            frequent and severe?”, but rather “where has the impact of droughts and floods on
            livelihoods—and ultimately food security—increased most?” This helps bridge the gap
            between the field of disaster risk reduction (which traditionally focuses on the physical
            occurrence of climate hazards) and that of livelihoods and food security analysis (which
            focuses on what people do for a living and how they obtain their food), in order to
            understand how specific climate risks impact the most vulnerable people.   </p>
          <p>Climate change in Afghanistan is not an uncertain, “potential” future concern, but a
            very real, present challenge— whose impacts have already been felt for years by
            millions of farmers and pastoralists across the country. This report seeks to highlight this
            by focusing primarily on changes that have already occurred in Afghanistan's climate
            der projected climate change in the last section. Despite the inherent uncertain-
            ties associated with climate projections, they help shed light on how the impacts
            on livelihoods that have already been observed might be exacerbated (or alle-
            viated) in the future.  </p>
